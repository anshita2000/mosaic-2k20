# Submission Instructions

All the submissions for the 1st round must be made in the formats described below. There are 2 files that you must complete.

- submission.py : In this file you must implement a function predict which will take as input an RGB image (which will have the captcha) and output the captcha in the image. Only this will be used by the coordinators to test your code. This means whatever model that you may have trained must be imported/loaded here. More details can be found in the file itself.
- requirements.txt : In this file you have to put all the dependencies for your code. Make sure all necessary libraries used are mentioned.
- characters.txt : In this file you will fill the character set on which your model is trained. Be truthful. You will be immediately disqualified if you give the wrong character set.

All the other code (for eg. the one you used to preprocess the data, prepare and train models) must be submitted along with the two above mentioned files. Make sure the submission.py file works properly by testing it using the sample **test** function given in the file. If this file doesn't run properly your code wont be validated.

# Testing

Based on your character set the coordinators will give examples in a format similar to that in **test** function of the submission.py. For all the testing images the black captcha will be written against white background. Final score and the images used will be decided by the coordinators and communicated to the participants. The decision of the coordinators will be final.

# Google Form
